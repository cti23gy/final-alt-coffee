The "COFFEE MAKERS" button in the nav will take you back to the main page.
This is how it works on the actual website.

My site was designed to replicate the Kurig website given in the assignment.

A Modal will appear when you Successfully login, signout, add to cart, and empty the cart.
When an item is in the cart, the cart icon will have a number next to it.

When shrinking the size of the window the navigation will compress into a hamburger window.
